### Ten Dead Men
My first game jam game ever. Back in 2016 I've attended TK Game Jam organized in Wrocław University of Technology. In game you are steering a character that has 10 seconds to live, and when he dies, he leaves his body at death point, so he's able to use it as new platform.

### The silence of the cat
On 2016 Slavic Game Jam we created a game about cat with special powers. Player would steer the animal to points where evil energy was stored and had to celanese them. It was loosely inspired on the idea presented in RPG *Cat* by *John Wick*. We've used a bit too many pixel shaders and therefore had to produce PC game instead of intended mobile.

### dziady
Dziady was a game made for a Game Jam in Theatre in Poznan. It it loosely based on *Adam Mickiewicz* book, *dziady pt. 2*. It is asynchronous co-op, where one player tries to reach end in standard platformer way, and other has to use special powers to help him (eg. move boxes that block characters path).

### SCP-35
[Secure Contain Protect] is a website that gathers many official-looking documents about unnatural events and entities. In SCP-35 game we put ourselves in place of two scientists who are trying to contain a breach in underwater, submarine research facility.

### Flood
Flood was created in span of 10 hours due to me testing pseudo-random dungeon generation based on physics engine. It happened during 3rd edition of TK Game Jam, where I was helping in organization. Game is targeted for mobile platforms, you try to run away from water that's flooding your lands. Longer you survive, more points you'll get.

### Eldrich depth
Game was created as Nordic Game Jam entry. It's asynchronous co-op, where one player is completely blind and must rely on his hearing to progress through level, and the other player has power over 'control room' where he sees map, can control doors and can talk to the blind player, helping him navigate.

### TwrDfns
Entry to Slavic Game Jam, game is classical tower defense with a twist. Usually tower defense games have static terrain, however in *TwrDfns* the terrain constantly changes, giving enemies new pathways.

### Hot bits
How about a small game about two ladies firing bullets at each other in attempt to overflow or underflow you *health* counter? Well, that's *hot bits*. Game was created for Global Game Jam.

### Animal Tower
Huuuge Games organized a game jam in collaboration with Google, on which we've created game about cute animals driving a sled downhill. The more animals you had, the higher points multiplier would be. Game was targeted at mobile phones.

### Cosmic chimp
Have you ever played minigame in Bioshock, where you need to connect pipes so the flow of water is continuous? How about a PvP version of that. Well, cosmic chimp is all that. With team of five we've managed to put up quite a game for Slavic Game Jam.

### swoboda ruchów
Again we've worked a bit with pixel shaders and physics to create game where cops need to put a body in a contour. Was fun, especially when many different poses were added to the game, some of which required you to separate victims body parts from each other - just so the contour fits. This was TK Game Jam entry.

### Simon Says - versus
On Slavic Game Jam we wanted to incorporate as many controllers as we could. So we came up with a game where player would create a sequence of buttons, and others playing with him would need to repeat it and expand it with their own choosing. We've also created mobile version of the game, with tiles which you'd need to press.

### Accessible dungeon
PGG Jam was targeted at games for people with disabilities. We've created a game in which you could use 3d sound to traverse the level. Additionally we used color pallette that should allow people with any kind of daltonism to play.
