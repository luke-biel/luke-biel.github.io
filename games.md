## 2016

### Ten Dead Men
My first game jam and in fact won one. Back in 2016 I've attended TK Game Jam organized by a group on University of Technology in Wroclaw. Game came out really good. Main mechanic was that you had to use your dead bodies as platforms in order to progress in levels. That, added with time limit for each of lives (**10 seconds** was a game jam theme) created quite unique mechanic.

### The silence of the cat
After TK I've gone to Warsaw for another game jam, where we've gone a little bit experimental. Theme was **90s**, we were 3 programmers, but two of us started doing graphics which left me to do all the programming. It came out weird, we've used a lot of pixel lighting, and in the end, game which we wanted to present on a phone had glitchy shaders on tha platform, so we've settled with PC.

### dziady
Dziady was made for a game jam in Theatre of Poznan. It it loosely based on Adam Mickiewicz book, *dziady pt. 2*. It is asynchronous cooperation, where we have to collaborate between player playing platformer characters and a 'hand' that helps player reach finish lane. Hand can use special skills, but only when beat of the music is hit.

### SCP-35
SCP is an internet pasta about a facility that functions somewhat like Men in Black, but a bit more realistic and, kinda more professional. I've based one of my games loosely on that universe. The game is about containment breach in a submarine located faculty. You play in co-op as two scientist that are trying to contain the SCPs let loose.

### Flood
This was first game jam I've been helping organize. I didn't intend to make game during it, but it happened somewhat randomly, when I was toying with physics based dungeon generation (if you try out the game you'll notice that it takes some time to generate level - it's caused by physics engine doing it's thing). Game was done by 10 on saturday, when I started coding it around 22 on friday. It was crazy night, *VEEERY* engaging flow. I may revisit it in the future as the idea is quite simple, and feedback was actually really positive.

### Eldrich depth
In 2017 I went to Denmark to attend **Nordic Game Jam**. Funny thing *Baba is you* won this exact jam, so competition was real. We were invited by Unity, visited their office in Copenhagen, had really nice time. And came u[ with async coop game where one player is completely blind. This is also a project I'd love to revisit in the future as the feeling when you were playing the game, listening to someone else whispering you commands and trying to hear if monster is coming to you were creating a really, really dense horror atmosphere.

### TwrDfns
After the Nordic happened next edition of Slavic Game jam and in this one we've (me and my friend Kuba) came up with a tower defense game where environment changes periodically. Not everything worked as expected, but hey, it's a jam, you gotta fail sometimes.

## 2018

### Hot bits
For Global Game Jam 2018 I've created a short game about shooting each other with guns that have **0** and **1** bullets. That's it. Our graphic really put heart into character portraits and what came out was good couch top-down shooter.

### Animal Tower
2018 brought much more polished games than previous years. First I've collaborated with Paweł and Wiola on Animal tower on Google/Huuge games game jam 3u-2o. Game came out practically finished, with nice mechanic of steering a sled with animals that may fall off if you drive too recklessly.

### Cosmic chimp
Have you ever played minigame in Bioshock, where you need to connect pipes so the flow of water is continuous? How about a PvP version of that. Well, cosmic chimp is all that. With team of five we've managed to put up quite a game.

### swoboda ruchów
If the sounds a bit odd it's because it's in polish. We've again worked a bit with pixel shaders and physics to create game where cops need to put a body in a contour. Was fun, especially when many different poses were added to the game.

### Simon Says - versus
This game came out in two versions, PC where you used all keyboards, pads, buttons attached to your PC to create a sequence which your opponent cannot reproduce, and a mobile one, which had colorful blocks and required you to follow the same rules, just on your phone screen.

### Accessible dungeon
This one's interesting production as it was my first contact with game for people with disabilities. We've produced a game that allows people with vision impairment to play it. It's color palette should allow colorblind players to *see* everything that a player with normal vision would, not like in other games, where some objects may be indistinguishable from the environment. Moreover, game uses sound to guide player - therefore someone with weak vision, or even blind can play it as well.
